## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _15.270 Ethical Practice: Leading Through Professionalism, Social Responsibility, and System Design_ as it was taught by Dr. Leigh Hafrey in Spring 2016.

This course introduces seminar participants to aspects of ethics in business, with a focus on general management. Students explore both the philosophy driving ethics and the daily challenges that managers face; they also engage with the subject with guest faculty and business and other professional practitioners. Individual sessions take the form of moderated discussion, with occasional short lectures from the instructor.
